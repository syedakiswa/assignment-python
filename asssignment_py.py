# Q2: Arithmetic operators

x = 20;
y = 6;

print(x + y); # Addition
print(x - y); # Subtraction
print(x * y); # Mutliplication
print(x / y);  # Division
print(x // y); # Floor Divsion
print(x % y);  # Modulus
print(x ** y); # Exponention

# Q3: Assignment Operators

num = 10;
num += 5;
num *= 2;
num -= 4;

print(num)

# Q4: Comparison Operators

a = 15;
b = 12;

print(a > b) # --> true
print(a < b) # --> false
print(a == b) # --> false
print(a != b) # --> true
print(a >= b) # --> true
print(a <= b) # --> false

# Q5: Logical Operators

p = True;
q = False;

p and q # --> false
p or q # --> true
not p # --> false
not q # --> true
